  <h1>l2netmgr - Lineage 2 Network Manager</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>l2netmgr is a GM tool to aid in administration of the official game
  servers.  Some of the server components provide a mechanism of interacting
  with them directly, without having to login a character.  l2netmgr connects
  to these components using this method and abstracts the details for the GM
  by providing simple commands to a telnet client.  Supported server components
  are AuthD and CacheD.</p>

  <p>Multiple administrators can connect at the same time through a variety
  of clients.  Windows and Solaris telnet clients have been tested, as well as
  PuTTY in telnet and raw mode.  Access is brokered through the use of a single
  password.</p>

  <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

  <p>The source is quite portable, and has been compiled and tested on Windows,
  Solaris, and Linux.  The Windows port also includes a GUI which can minimize
  to the system tray.  Packaged binaries are available for all three platforms.
