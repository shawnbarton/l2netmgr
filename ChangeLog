Lineage 2 Network Manager ChangeLog

Version 0.4.4

o No longer connects to the providers when a user logs in

Version 0.4.3

o Overhauled keepalive subsystem.
o Better handling of lost provider connections.  It no longer stalls
  while attempting to reconnect, but instead gives the user an error
  message that the requested provider is down.

Version 0.4.2

o Check for, and ignore, telnet control codes. PuTTY telnet mode now
  works correctly.
